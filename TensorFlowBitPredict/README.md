# BitPredictions-TensorFlow

This project focuses on time series analysis using TensorFlow to predict Bitcoin prices. The goal is to build a model that can effectively forecast the price movements of Bitcoin based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical Bitcoin price data, typically obtained from cryptocurrency exchanges or financial data providers. The dataset includes features such as timestamped price data, trading volume, and possibly sentiment analysis metrics.

## Goal

The primary objective is to develop a robust time series forecasting model using TensorFlow. The model will be trained on historical Bitcoin price data and evaluated based on its ability to predict future price movements.
