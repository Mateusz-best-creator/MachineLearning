In this project, we explore distributed training strategies using TensorFlow with multiple cores, including TPU (Tensor Processing Units). This notebook demonstrates how to leverage TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.Strategy` API to train models efficiently on a single device or across multiple devices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can vary depending on the specific task. For demonstration purposes, we typically use popular datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10 to showcase the effectiveness of distributed training strategies.

## Goal

The primary goal is to implement and compare different distributed training strategies on TPUs and other devices to optimize model training performance and efficiency.
