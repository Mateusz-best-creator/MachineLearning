# SkimLit

SkimLit is an NLP project that aims to classify sentences in Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts. The project leverages popular data science libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy to process text data.

## Dataset

The project uses the PubMed 200k RCT dataset, which was released alongside a research paper. This dataset consists of approximately 200,000 labeled RCT abstracts. Each abstract's sentences are labeled to indicate their role in the abstract.

## Goal

The main goal of SkimLit is to explore and develop NLP models capable of classifying the role of each sentence in an RCT abstract. By analyzing the sequence of sentences, the models aim to determine their function, such as background, objective, method, result, or conclusion.
