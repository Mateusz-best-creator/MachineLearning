# Dog-Vision-TensorFlow-ML

This project aims to classify 120 different dog breeds from images using TensorFlow. The project is inspired by a popular Kaggle competition and leverages deep learning techniques to predict the breed of a dog based on its image.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset consisting of images of 120 different dog breeds. The dataset was made available during a Kaggle competition and is used here to train and evaluate the model.

## Goal

The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately classify dog breeds from images. The model will be trained on a diverse set of images and evaluated on its ability to predict the correct breed.
