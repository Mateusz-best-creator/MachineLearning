# MNIST_recognition_TensorFlow

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using multiple models implemented with TensorFlow. The goal is to explore different model architectures and identify the one with the best performance.

## Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 handwritten digit images, each 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Goal

The primary goal is to build and compare various neural network models to achieve the highest possible accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.
