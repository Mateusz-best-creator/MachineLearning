# PyTorch_DogBreeds

This project focuses on classifying dog breeds using PyTorch, leveraging deep learning techniques. Inspired by a popular Kaggle competition, the goal is to accurately predict the breed of a dog from its image using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of 120 different dog breeds. This dataset is typically sourced from the Kaggle competition or other similar repositories and is structured with labeled images for supervised learning.

## Goal

The primary objective is to build and train a deep learning model in PyTorch that can classify dog breeds with high accuracy. The model will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify the breed of dogs from unseen images.
