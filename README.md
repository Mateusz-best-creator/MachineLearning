# Machine Learning

## Short description

This repository contains all my work related to Machine Learning. It includes several projects implemented with Sklearn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, covering various domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, as well as simpler tasks like regression or classification with Sklearn.

The projects feature a wide range of visualization charts and graphs, primarily created using Matplotlib and Pandas. Additionally, Seaborn was utilized for some tables.

Feel free to explore the code and learn!
